## 🛠️ How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Abhi95081/Typing-Speed-Test-Game.git
cd TypingSpeedTestGame

### 🔍 Behind the Scenes
 # -> 📚 Trie Data Structure
Efficient word storage and retrieval system that allows:

# -> Fast word access

Easy scalability (themes, levels)

# -> 📏 WPM & Accuracy
 -> WPM = (Correct Words / Time in Minutes)

-> Accuracy = (Correct Words / Total Words) × 100

# 🧪 Future Enhancements
-> 🔐 User login and profile-based progress tracking

-> 🧠 Adaptive difficulty and themes

-> 🏆 Leaderboards and multiplayer typing race

-> 📱 Mobile version with Flutter/React Native

-> 🧑‍🏫 AI-based feedback on common mistakes

# 🏆 Achievements
✅ Implemented Trie-based fast word generation

✅ Real-time performance tracking

✅ Minimal terminal-based UI with cross-platform support

✅ Successfully completed under academic timeline
